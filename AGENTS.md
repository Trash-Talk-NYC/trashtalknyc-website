# Trash Talk NYC Website

## What this project is  

This is a website for Trash Talk NYC associated with @trashtalk_nyc (on Instagram, @trashtalknyc on TikTok). David Clarke is behind the account, and posts short-form videos cleaning up NYC-literally, with a grabber and trash bag and the phone strapped to his chest. 
He reached out to me, Fabi, to make the website. 

## What the website does
* Act as centralized place to find Trash Talk NYC Cleanup Events that anyone can attend
* Act as the place to find cleanup event descriptions, and any updates to specific events.
* Clearly display ways to donate and what past donations are going towards
* Clearly display Trash Talk NYC mission, objectives, and act as a canvas where we display our progress, wins, updates, and projects
* Importantly, it is the place where people sign up for a newsletter, and getting the emails of those interested is paramount.
* Also importantly, it is the place where interested creators, organizations, and companies/enterprises can contact us to collaborate.

## Current Stack

* Astro framework
* Netlify hosting
* Netlify Functions
* Brevo for emailing tens of thousands of people
* Eventbrite integration 
* Web3Forms integration
* GoFundMe embeds

## E2E Testing

See the `e2e-testing` skill (`.agents/skills/e2e-testing/SKILL.md`) for how to choose between `astro dev`, `npm run dev`, and `netlify dev`, and what to verify for each kind of change (UI-only, Eventbrite-rendering, signups, contact forms, Brevo). Kept out of this always-loaded file so it only enters context when actually testing something.
